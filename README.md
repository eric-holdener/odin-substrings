# odin-substrings

This substrings problem was alot easier for me to solve than the problem before it - the caesar cipher. I have alot of self taught practical experience with arrays and iterations, through making automations for excel documents, so going through each array and how to structure it seemed intuitive to me.

I look forward to the future this year when I review this code and find a way to make it more condensed than it already is, because I do want to get better at refactoring and cleaning code.

Overall the hardest part for me was writing to hashes, as I'm still getting a grasp around how to interact with the hash, key value structure, but I do feel like I'm improving with time.
